The goal of this project was to build a maze generator using a genetic algorithm, optimizing for parameters we thought were useful in making the maze itself difficult for human subjects. After that, we conducted a survey to determine how effective our generator was. We found a weak correlation (r=0.37) between the usage of our model and the difficulty as graded by the participants. Due to technical limitations, we created 8x8 mazes, which might have contributed to them generally being easy to the participants, regardless of the usage of our model. Future work could include larger mazes, a more objective method of measuring difficulty than self-report (such as an interactive online game), analysis of different parameters that may contribute to maze difficulty, as well as redesigning the genetic algorithm itself to induce more exploration of the solution space.

The parameters that our maze generator was optimized for were:

- number of steps necessary for A* algorithm to find the solution
- total number of steps outside the optimal path (scaled by 0.7)
- number of turns in the entire maze

To generate mazes we used a matrix of probabilities created by our maze generator to guide a minimum spanning tree algorithm.

For the survey itself, we used Google Forms. There were 4 mazes generated by our method and 8 random mazes. Participants rated their difficulty from 1 to 10. Questions were shuffled every time so that the effect of the order of mazes on the participant's difficulty response would be accounted for when averaging all the responses out. There were 63 responses to the survey and the correlation found of difficulty as reported by humans and our method usage was r=0.37.
